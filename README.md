# discord-oauth
Example of Python code for Discord OAuth intergration for authentication/etc.

All done via python, perhaps an unconventional language for Discord OAuth, but uses flask library primarily.
Hopefully this will help with people wanting to implement Discord OAuth into their flask applications quickly! :)
